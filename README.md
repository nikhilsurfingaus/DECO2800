## Game Overview
Deco Combat Evolved (DCE) is a 2-player co-op game set on a remote Earth-like planet that humans have since established life on. It is discovered that the 8 communication towers used to keep in contact with Earth have been deactivated. Players are given the mission of reversing this.

The players begin the game crash-landed on the planet in a desolate area due to having sustained damage to their vehicle during orbital landing. Gameplay involves traversing the planet for resources for survival, as well as to locate, defend and take back the communication towers. Both players experience the same day and night mode and can interact in the world.
